# Browserify
     For using node js module we have need to browserify first to run on browser. Without browserify 
     browser can't define the require library of node.js. so we have need to import any module/file to another module 
     write a code such like this.
     
                              browserify app.js -o pichart.js
           
           
    this means import pichart module to app.js module
